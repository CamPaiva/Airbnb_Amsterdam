# Airbnb Amsterdam
This project was undertaken for the Python for Data Science Advanced course at [TechAcademy](https://www.tech-academy.io/) in 2021/2022. 
We were supposed to follow a Guide/Leitfaden indicating the tasks we had to accomplish, so the information might sometimes be hard to follow without that context.
The project used data from Airbnb, and each individual had to work on a specific city. Mine was Amsterdam.
The first portion is dedicated to exploratory data analysis and visualization, and the second to a price prediction model using machine learning.
